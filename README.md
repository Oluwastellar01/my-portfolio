# my-portfolio
This is my last exercise in my web2 class. 
i have been working on creating my portfolio before now, but when i saw that its part of our final assesment, that was the reason i choose to design and develop the plan i had, it was an urgent 
so i was unable to add contents to it. Thanks @Adetutu for impacting knowledge.
